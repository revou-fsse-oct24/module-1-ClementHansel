## Web Interface

Hi ! Welcome to my **Assignment 1** in RevoU Class. The purpose of this documentation is to provide me or others with information about the website that i made.

The website is intended to show my understanding of what I have learnt in Module 1. The website that I made consisted of :

1. Index.html
2. signup.html
3. Tutorial.html
4. Contactus.html
5. Readme.md

### Index.html

In this web page you will see the landing page, with sticky navbar, video running in loop in background, and a header that should be shown at the bottom of the first screen.

The idea is to have 1 full screen for the navbar, video background, and the bottom header. the page will show well in large screens as i still have problem with other device displays.

the next scroll should show the HTML, CSS, and JS section. each of this section should have the button linked to Tutorial.html using a javascript.
This is intended to show the difference of button usage between Javascript and html "a" tag.

The last section is the testimony section showing grid template with css. This section I made following the instruction from youtube, while the job is done, there are some function that I still dont understand. As I failed to replicate it well in the second section.

The functionality of the website is as follows :

1. Home navbar will redirect to index.html
2. Tutorial navbar will redirect to tutorial.html
3. Contact US navbar will redirect to contactus.html
4. Tutorial button will redirect to tutorial.html
5. Sign Up button will redirect to signup.html
6. HTML Tutorial link will redirect to external website link
7. CSS Tutorial link will redirect to external website link
8. Javasript Tutorial link will redirect to external website link

### signup.html

This web page will showcase the signup and signin page. It still not fully functional and all the buttons will not work as i havent linked it to the proper destination. but the main idea is to show my understanding of transition and form element.

### Tutorial.html

This web page will show some basic HTML elements and tag. The purpose of this page is to have all the content about HTML, CSS, and JS, also some more in-depth learning material. But i didnt manage to finish is because i was trying to fix some function and responsiveness of index.html

### Contactus.html

This web page will show the form element and some radio button for the purpose of previous assignment. Again, I will try to develop it better in the future.
